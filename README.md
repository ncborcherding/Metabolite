# The mouse tissue metabolome rapidly degrades after terminal loss of perfusion.

## Manuscript Abstract 

Metabolomic regulation is rapid, highly dynamic, and intrinsically linked to oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor 
of the electron transport chain. Thus, loss of oxygen supply quickly propagates to broad metabolomic disruption. 
However, the timing of broad hypoxia-induced metabolomic changes elicited by tissue dissection is not well described. 
The implications of this absence for past and current metabolomic inquiries across the life sciences are far-reaching. 
Here, we examine the stability of the mouse liver metabolome during up to 10 minutes of acute hypoxia following tissue 
dissection. Striking metabolomic changes occur within 30 seconds of tissue dissection, and the magnitudes of these 
changes are amplified with time. Using a liver-specific knockout model of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and 
applying the tissue-dissection time course, we observe phenotypic differences to be abrogated while other artifactual 
differences arise. Using [U-13C]-glucose, we show distinct changes in the enrichment patterns of metabolites during 
acute hypoxia consistent with distal TCA cycle reversal. Finally, we extend this model of tissue-dissection dependent 
hypoxia to skeletal muscle and observed similar changes to those of the  liver on a similar time scale. Together, 
these results demonstrate the exquisite sensitivity of the liver metabolome to hypoxia and a framework for best 
practices for sample collection and data reporting to ensure the robustness and repeatability of future metabolomic 
studies.
